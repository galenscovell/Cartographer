Cave-Creator
======

<b>Description:</b>
<blockquote>Cave and maze creator in Java. Utilizes cellular automata and an elegant interface to construct randomized and varied pixel worlds. I'm having a lot of fun adding functionality to it, so check back for updates.</blockquote>

<b>Features:</b>
* Cellular automata for spontaneous creation of a grid-based world
* Swing interface with checkbox and slider options including FPS, tile size, margin, and smooth passes
* Utilization of sound object-oriented design principles including interfaces, clean separation of responsibilities and package organization
* Exploratory pathfinding unit which traverses world and fills in layout
* Pause and resume functionality
* Planned: More build options (Miner unit, color options, more world types)
